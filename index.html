    <u><i>Project 77</i></u>
    <hr>
    <p>Visual Studio Code is just like Brackets IDE. It doesn't need any internet connection to work on. It can be used for creating HTML webpages. You can also add CSS and JS elements.</p>
    <p>The console section is found when you open the inspect section. To display any text in it you first have to create a variable for it such as var name="Manvir";. Then display the variable on console like this console.log(variable name);.</p>
    <script>
        var first_name="Manvir"
        var last_name=" Jethwani"
        var fullname=first_name.concat(last_name);
        console.log(fullname);
        var a=10;
        var b=5
        var ans=Math.pow(a,b);
        console.log(ans);
        </script>
